## 🏥 Project Overview

The **Smart Healthcare Monitoring & Risk Prediction Platform** is a **scalable, data-driven system** designed to shift healthcare from reactive monitoring to **predictive and preventive care**.  

It integrates:
- Batch and streaming patient data ingestion
- Robust ETL pipelines for clean, structured time-series data
- ML-based risk classification & anomaly detection
- Interactive dashboards and simulated alert systems

> This project emphasizes **enterprise-grade data engineering**, focusing on reliable pipelines, data governance, and ML evaluation—not just predictive models.
